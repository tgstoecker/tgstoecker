Hi, my name is Tyll StÃ¶cker and I'm a (bioinformatics) software developer and data scientist. I'm living in Germany and currently working at the University of Bonn where I am finishing my PhD in Bioinformatics. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tgstoecker) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyllstoecker/).  
I am always looking to connect with people in related fields and explore ideas and opportunities.

## ðŸ”­ Research
 For the last five years I have performed agricultural and human genetics research and developed software for analyzing next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing data. Most of my work I do in R, Python, Rust, and Bash. I have a passion for generating clean and effective graphics; especially using R Shiny to build web applications that tell interactive data stories.
